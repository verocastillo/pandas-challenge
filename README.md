Repository with the documents, code and results of my homework using Pandas programming.

**Heroes of Pymoli**
The scenario of this challenge starts with me landing a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. This game has in-App purchases, which means that while it's free, you can purchase optional items to enhance your play experience. I generated a report to the company that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

*What does my final report include?*
- Player Count
- Purchasing Analysis (Total)
- Gender Demographics
- Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
- Age Demographics
- Purchasing Analysis (Agw)
- Top Spenders
- Most Popular Items
- Most Profitable Items
